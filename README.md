# 👋 Hi, I'm Christophe

PHP/Symfony developer with a real passion for **clean, maintainable, and scalable code**. I like when code is readable, documented, and serves a clear business need.

> 🧠 *Clean code, pragmatism, and product sense above all.*

---

## 🚀 What I do

* **PHP 8.x** development following best practices
* **Symfony** framework (API, back-office, front Twig, components)
* Project integration & industrialization (Sulu, Sylius)
* **DDD / hexagonal architecture** when appropriate
* Legacy code refactoring and modernization

---

## 🧩 Main Stack

* **Backend**: PHP, Symfony, Doctrine, API Platform
* **CMS / E-commerce**: Sulu, Sylius
* **Frontend**: Twig, Twig Components, some JS when needed (no over-engineering)
* **Infra / Tools**: Docker, Git, CI/CD, Traefik
* **Quality**: PHPStan, PHP-CS-Fixer, tests when relevant

---

## 🧠 How I work

* Understand the **business need** before writing code
* Favor **simplicity** over over-engineering
* Leave code that **others can pick up without suffering**
* Challenge when needed, deliver when needed

---

## 📍 Currently

* Developing on **Symfony / Sylius / Sulu projects**
* Working on quality, maintainability, and industrialization
* Always curious about architecture, DX, clean code
